## Overview

This is my solution to the interactive rating component challenge. It was built entirely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Screenshot

**The main card:** the first thing the users see.
